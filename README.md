### Overview

Project for building a movie app that can check the latest movies based on categories.

### Getting started
The steps that must follow to built this App:
<ul>
<li>first  user should create a new repo then clone it.</li>
<li>Create Node enviroment by type; (npm init) in the terminal.</li>
<li>Installa express framework;type (npm install express).</li>
<li>open vs code.</li>
<li>create new file.js to start bulding a server.</li>
<li>The code in the js file must follow those steps:<br>
1- require the package.<br>
2- express app.<br>
3- create fun to listening to any request.<br>
4- to reach a json data we need to create an array of objects by creating constructor.<br>
5- create routes(endpoints) to establish a connection between user and server.<br>

In this phase, I complete working on GURD, and started updating and deleting from the database through my server.

*note* -- To run the server from terminal type (node.index.js).

</ul>
